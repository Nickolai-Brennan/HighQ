# ðŸš€ ADHD-Aligned Project Supervisor â€“ KBD-First System

Welcome to a project built under the **ADHD-Aligned Tech Supervisor Framework** â€“ where clarity, simplicity, and meaningful execution come first. This system is designed for builders, creatives, analysts, and ADHD-brained innovators who need structure **without suffocation**, and flexibility **without chaos**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Mission

To eliminate tool fatigue, prevent doomscroll productivity spirals, and **replace overthinking with output**.

We begin every build with a KBD â€“ **Key Build Dashboard**. No distractions. No app-hunting. Just execution.

## ðŸ§  Principles

- **One Tool Per Purpose**: prevent tool overlap and noise.
- **Default to Action**: reduce cognitive clutter by doing, not hunting.
- **Visual + Tactile Tracking**: Use Trello/Notion to stay engaged.
- **Dopamine Feedback Loops**: Micro-wins and visible momentum.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Rhythm (ADHD-Aligned)

- **Mon**: Visualize project path, check KBD status.
- **Tueâ€“Thu**: Deep work blocks with optional guardrails.
- **Fri**: Async demo, dopamine review, celebrate wins.
- **Weekend (opt-in)**: Creative sandbox, non-obligated exploration.
