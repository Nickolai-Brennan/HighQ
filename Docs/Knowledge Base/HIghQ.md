# 🧠 **HighQ – Cognitive Project Operating System**

*A neurodivergent-friendly method for managing creative chaos and building meaningful output.*

## 🥇 HighQ Step 1: Daily Self-Assessment + Input Clearing

### 🎯 Purpose:

This step centers your mind **before** the work starts. You take a 3-minute pulse check to prevent scattered thinking and burnout. Then, you **clear your headspace** (Google Keep, tabs, sticky notes) and move items into proper systems.

### ✅ Self-Assessment Template

| Category             | Score (0–10) | Notes / Triggers                              |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Focus             |              | What’s pulling attention?                     |
| 🔋 Energy            |              | Feeling low? High? Flatlined?                 |
| 🧘 Mental Wellness   |              | Mood, anxiety, clarity?                       |
| 🌧️ Depression Scale |              | 0 = Clear / 10 = Dark cloud                   |
| ❤️ Self-Worth        |              | Do I believe in myself today? Why or why not? |
| 🏃 Physical Body     |              | Sleep, pain, hunger, hydration?               |

**📝 Reflection:**

> *What do I need today? (energy, clarity, silence, validation…)*
> *What helped or hurt yesterday?*

---

### 📥 Input Clearing Protocol

1. ✅ **Open Google Keep / Notes / Inbox**
2. ✅ Move any task, idea, or reminder into:

   * ⬇️ Project Tracker (Notion / Trello / Sheets)
   * 📂 Archive or delete irrelevant ones
3. ✅ Choose 1–3 anchor priorities for today

**Example:**

> “Idea for a podcast title” → HighQ Folder → “Hold Ideas – Creative”
> “Fix homepage nav bar” → Sports Site → Sprint Queue

## 🥈 HighQ Step 2: Project Inventory + Goal Clarity

### 🎯 Purpose:

Take everything you're working on and **visually organize it** by purpose, tools, and friction points. This reduces overload and builds project confidence.

---

### ✅ Project Clarity Template

```markdown
### ✅ [PROJECT NAME]

- 🎯 **Project Goal:** One clear sentence on what this project is trying to do.
- 🧩 **Why it matters:** What impact will this make on your world or others?
- 🛠 **Tools Used (KBD loadout):**
  - Tool 1
  - Tool 2
  - Tool 3
- ⏱️ **Status / Timeframe:** % complete, stage, or estimate
- ⚠️ **Barriers or Frustrations:** What’s holding you back right now?
```

---

### 🧠 Project Dump Guidelines

Start by listing everything you're actively working on, want to build, or feel responsible for—*even if it's stalled.*

**Examples:**

* 🔬 RRI: Building reliever scoring system
* 📊 ProspeX: Prospect research DB
* 🎨 HighQ: Your productivity system
* 🕹️ CheatZ: Fantasy draft toolkit
* 🧠 Writing: Essay or story collection
* 🌌 StarTrekDB: Canon builder playground

Then convert each into a full clarity card using the template above.

---

Absolutely — here is the **complete HighQ Step 3: Prioritization Matrix + Action Sort** as a **template** with clear instructions.

---

# 🧠 HighQ Step 3: Prioritization Matrix + Action Sort

*Turn ideas into order. Cut through the noise. Identify your execution path.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose:

To organize your active, upcoming, and stalled projects into a **priority-driven visual tracker** with clear next steps. This helps avoid scattered focus and ensures you're only moving what *needs to move* right now.

## 🧠 How to Use the Matrix

1. 🧠 Brain-dump all your current projects
2. 🔍 Assign each a **Focus Score** + Timeframe
3. 🎯 Pick **1 Anchor Task** that will move it forward
4. 🚧 Identify **what’s stopping you**
5. 🧼 Only activate tasks from Focus 5 and 4
6. 🔁 Re-sort weekly or bi-weekly

---
Let’s do it right — we’ll build the **HighQ Sprint Board Template** that you can reuse *every week* across all projects.

# 🏁 HighQ Step 4: Dopamine Sprint Execution

*Finish more by shrinking the battlefield. Focus on momentum, not magnitude.*

---

## 🧠 Purpose:

To convert your top priorities into **daily, dopamine-friendly micro-goals**, each tied to a **single anchor project**.

HighQ sprints are built around:

* ✅ Visibility (small wins, checkboxes)
* 🧠 Simplicity (1 task = 1 box)
* 🧬 Reward (you feel good just by completing the process)

---

## 📆 HighQ Weekly Sprint Template

```markdown
# 🗓️ Weekly Sprint Plan – [Week of: ________]

## 🎯 Sprint Goal (What success looks like by Friday):  
> Write one clear goal tied to a Focus 5 project.  
> Example: “Launch FBCS3 sign-up site and post 3 recruitment promos.”

Would you like me to:

* 🧠 Generate this into **Notion** or **Google Sheets**?
* 🧾 Create a version with **automated dopamine XP points** (e.g. 5 pts per habit)?
* 📄 Export it as a printable or fillable PDF for journaling?

Then we’ll plug in your current projects (FBCS3, RRI, Sports Site) and begin execution.
