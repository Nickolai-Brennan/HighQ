## 📁 Asset Standards

| Asset Type  | Format           | Size (px) | Notes                                |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Logos       | `.png`           | 512×512   | Transparent background               |
| Banners     | `.jpg/.png`      | 1200×675  | Landscape for site and social use    |
| Icons       | `.svg` or `.png` | 64×64     | Use flat or single-color             |
| Screenshots | `.jpg`           | 1080p min | Label clearly with date/project/page |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

* All files use consistent naming: `ProjectName_Component_Version.ext`
  e.g., `FBCS3_Logo_v1.0.png`
* Folder names use underscores (`_`) not spaces
* Markdown for all text-based files
* PNG for graphics with transparency
* JPG for previews and wide-format banners
* Use `ChangeLog.md` to document each change **before** publishing or sharing

---

Would you like me to:

* Generate this as a downloadable **Docs Pack template folder** (with blanks)?
* Build out a version for your current top projects like RRI, FBCS3, HighQ?
* Push this directly to a GitHub repo with sample files?

Let’s operationalize it.
